## Features

- **Customizable Difficulty**: Users can set the maximum factor for their multiplication practice.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app saves user progress in local storage, so your practice data is always available.
- **Four Practice States**:
  - Answered Correctly
  - Answered Incorrectly
  - Answered Quickly
  - Not Answered
- **Adaptive Learning**: If the user answers more than 90% of the questions correctly, the app suggests increasing the maximum factor for a greater challenge.
- **Spaced Repetition**: For continued practice without increasing the maximum factor, the app uses a simple spaced repetition algorithm, prioritizing questions that were answered incorrectly or not yet answered.
- - **Mobile friendly**: Since it is a flutter app it can be easily saved as PWA, and UI is responsive to the screensize.

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Max Factor**: Choose the highest number you want to practice multiplication with.
2. **Start Practicing**: Answer multiplication questions.
3. **Get Feedback**: Based on your answers, questions will be categorized into one of the four states.
4. **Improve**: If you achieve over 90% correct answers, the app will suggest increasing the difficulty. If you choose not to, the app will help you focus on questions that need more practice using spaced repetition.

Happy practicing!
